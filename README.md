# mc-server

# A vanilla 1.15 Minecraft server - hosted on Heroku

Set this up when I got sick of using Hamachi as a *fake* `local area network` to be able to play with friends on our Minecraft server. Uses the Fantastic [Heroku Minecraft Buildpack](https://github.com/jkutner/heroku-buildpack-minecraft) so pretty much all the code is happening on Heroku.
